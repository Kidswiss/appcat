= VSHN Redis Function-io

The set of transformation go functions applied to a VSHN Redis composition.

== Maintenance

Redis maintenances supports only patch upgrades.
There's no plan to add automatic minor or major upgrades due to possible breaking changes in newer Redis versions.

=== AppCat Implementation

In AppCat there's a cronjob deployed for each instance that is provisioned.
This cronjob will trigger a Patch update `Job`.
The latest patch version is being looked up in the official https://hub.docker.com/_/redis[docker repository].
If a newer patch version is available, then Redis will be updated.
