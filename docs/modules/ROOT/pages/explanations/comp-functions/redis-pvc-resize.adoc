= Redis PVC resize

This process requires the `bitnami/kubectl` image.
So if AppCat is deployed to an air gapped cluster, please keep this in mind.

Resizing the PVCs for Redis is a mutlistage process:

. A job that crosschecks if the sts PVC template size is equal to the size in the request
. If they don't match the current sts will be deleted with the `--cascade=orphan` option. This is because the sts can't be adjusted once it's created. The cascade option leaves the pods running.
. Then the helm release will be updated to trigger the re-creation of the sts
. Once the sts is re-created it will add an annotation so it's picked up by the statefulset-resize-controller
. The statefulset-resize-controller then actually handles the resize of the PVCs
