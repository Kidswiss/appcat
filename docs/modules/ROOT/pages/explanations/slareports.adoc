= SLA Reports

== How do they work?

This is a simple SLA reporting tool.
It connects to a Prometheus/Thanos/Mimir instance and queries them to gather the SLA information.

It currently requires the information provided by the AppCat SLI exporter, as well as the `appuio.io/organization` label by joining the namespace information.
It also requires the `cluster_id` label, which is currently available on the `SLO Mimir` endpoint.

It then creates an ASCIIdoc template and sends it to VSHN's docgen.
There it will be converted to a PDF and sent back to the slareporter.
The slareporter will then upload the PDFs to the configured S3 bucket.

By default the slareporter will take the current time and a range of 30 days to query and calculate the SLA reports.
This can be adjusted, please consult the commands help for more information.
