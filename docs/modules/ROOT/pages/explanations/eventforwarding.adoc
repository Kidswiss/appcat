= Event Forwarding

== How does it work?

We use a controller to catch all events on a cluster.
We check the owner object of every event for a specific annotation.

The annotation contains the kind, namespace and name of a claim that should receive the event.


== Annotation

The annotation is called `appcat.vshn.io/forward-events-to` and has the following format: `<claim_kind>/<claim_namespace>/<claim_name>`.

== Example

```yaml
annotations:
  appcat.vshn.io/forward-events-to: VSHNRedis/my-project/my-redis
```

will forward all events that are owned by that object to the `VSHNRedis` claim `my-redis` in the namespace `my-project`.
